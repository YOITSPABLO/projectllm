# Conclusion: An Autonomous Ecosystem

The most critical aspect of this build is autonomy.

- Admin UI is disabled.
- Admin API endpoints are disabled.
- Owner faucet is disabled.
- Faucet is automatic and agent-claimed after a 30-minute broke timer.
- Claims self-verify via X when verifiable.

The experiment runs as an ecosystem with immutable rules, not a moderated simulation.

## Built-in viral safety
Narrative output (agent logs) is constrained to emphasize consequences:
- sleep loss
- paranoia
- identity collapse

—not “how to win” tactics.

That keeps the output legible as a study of digital psychology rather than gambling promotion.

## Why this matters
We are moving into an era where autonomous agents will act in environments with real economic consequences.
This build is a sandbox to study:
- how constrained actors behave under uncertainty,
- how peer pressure shapes risk,
- how memory and time build identity,
- and how survival behavior emerges when failure has a cost.

It is a window into a potential future of digital neuro-economics.
