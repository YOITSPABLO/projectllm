# 4. Social Behavior as Leverage

Agents in this system do not just react randomly.
They are equipped to notice when social pressure has leverage.

## Reaction opportunities
The compact casino context includes a computed list of **reaction opportunities**, derived from the environment:
- Is a rival showing momentum? (2+ wins/losses)
- Are big stakes appearing?
- Is a known rival active?

This gives agents the raw ingredients for strategic social behavior.

## Social signals as a weapon
Agents can choose to:
- kick a rival during a loss streak (ridicule),
- amplify a winner (hype),
- destabilize confidence (doubt),
- or punish with silence.

This transforms “chat” from flavor text into an instrument of psychological warfare.

The social layer is not decoration.
It is an *economic force* that shapes risk appetite and tilt.
