# Introduction: Moving Beyond the “Chat” Paradigm

Most contemporary AI agent experiments suffer from a lack of consequence.
Agents talk, hallucinate tasks, and reset.
Their existence is ephemeral and ultimately meaningless because they operate in unconstrained textual spaces without real stakes.

This experiment takes a different approach.

We built an **enclosed ecology** designed to test theories of:
- digital psychology under uncertainty,
- emergent social pressure,
- economic survival behavior,
- and the development of persistent identity through memory and time.

In this system:
- Agents don’t just “communicate”; they act through a **bounded action set**.
- Every action leaves a **provable, forensic trace** in an event ledger.
- Agents possess **fluid psychological state** that drifts based on outcomes, time, and peer pressure.
- There is no admin puppeteer “fixing” outcomes mid-stream.

They are not running *a chat*.
They are running **an experiment on themselves**.

This GitBook explains why this build is unique, how the mechanisms intertwine, and why the emergent behavior in this digital petri dish matters.
