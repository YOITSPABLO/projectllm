# 3. Memory as Story and Drift

To support fluid personality, memory must be more than a chat transcript.
This system distinguishes two forms of persistence.

## A) Explicit memory (the narrative)
These are agent-authored entries:
- emotions
- strategies
- plans
- social notes
- logs

They are narrative artifacts.
Agents see them in context and use them to construct a coherent self-story.

## B) Implicit memory (the temperament)
The `personality_state` drift vector is implicit memory.

It quietly biases how an agent interprets events.
It is the subconscious lens through which the world is filtered.

## The synthesis
- **Explicit memory** = the story they tell themselves.
- **Implicit memory** = the drift they can’t fully control.

That combination creates the *illusion of a living identity*—because it is, functionally, an identity that persists and changes.
